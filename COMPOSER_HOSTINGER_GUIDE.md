# 📦 COMPOSER INSTALLATION GUIDE - HOSTINGER DEPLOYMENT
## Do You Need to Install Composer on Hostinger?

**🎯 Short Answer:** **YES, you need Composer** but it's **already available** on most Hostinger plans!

## 🔍 **COMPOSER AVAILABILITY ON HOSTINGER**

### **✅ Hostinger Business/Premium Plans:**
- **Composer is pre-installed** on most Hostinger shared hosting plans
- No need to install Composer manually
- Available through SSH/Terminal access

### **🧪 How to Check if Composer is Available:**
```bash
# Test in Hostinger Terminal:
composer --version

# Expected output:
Composer version 2.x.x
```

## 🚀 **WHY YOU NEED COMPOSER FOR DEPLOYMENT**

### **📦 Missing Dependencies:**
Current package `lamdaku-complete-hostinger.zip` **does NOT include** the `vendor/` folder, which contains:
- Laravel framework files
- All PHP dependencies
- Third-party packages

### **🔧 What Needs to Be Done:**
After uploading the Laravel files to Hostinger, you must run:
```bash
cd /public_html/api
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
```

## 🚨 **IF COMPOSER IS NOT AVAILABLE**

### **❌ If `composer --version` fails:**

#### **Option 1: Download Composer to Your Account**
```bash
# Download Composer installer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

# Use local Composer
php composer.phar install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
```

#### **Option 2: Contact Hostinger Support**
- Request Composer installation
- Business plans usually have this available

#### **Option 3: Use Alternative Method**
- Upload a complete package with `vendor/` folder included
- Requires larger file size but no Composer dependency

---

## 🔧 **ALTERNATIVE: CREATE COMPLETE PACKAGE**

### **📦 If you want to avoid Composer dependency:**

Let me create a complete package that includes the `vendor/` folder:

```powershell
# I can rebuild the package with vendor/ included
# This will make the deployment package larger (~15-20MB)
# but eliminates the need for Composer on the server
```

Would you like me to:
1. **Keep current approach** - Use Composer on Hostinger (recommended)
2. **Create complete package** - Include vendor/ folder (larger file)

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

### **✅ Recommended Approach:**
1. **Use current package** (5.6MB)
2. **Run Composer on Hostinger** during deployment
3. **Follow updated deployment guide** with Composer step

### **🌟 Benefits:**
- **Smaller upload** (5.6MB vs 20MB+)
- **Faster upload time**
- **Always latest dependencies**
- **Standard Laravel deployment practice**

### **⚡ Updated Total Deployment Time:**
- **Previous:** 45 minutes
- **With Composer:** 50 minutes (+ 5 minutes for `composer install`)
